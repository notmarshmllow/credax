  # MATCHING STATUS CODES
  Use `-c` switch to filter HTTP Status Code from response. This switch accepts one single Status Code only.
   
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -c 200`
  
  # OUTPUT RESULTS TO A FILE
  Write output to a file using `-o` switch.
  
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -o filename.txt`
  
  # FUZZ LIST OF URLS
  
  Fuzz a list of URLs, store output in file and activate slack notifications with following command.
  
  `./credax.sh urllist wordlist`
  
  # POST REQUESTS
  
  Use `-POST` to send POST Requests. By default Credax sends GET Requests for Fuzzing.
  
  `python3 credax.py -d https://example.com/ -w wordlist.txt -POST`
  
  # BYPASSING 403 RESPONSES
 
 CREDAX by default tries to **bypass 403 Resopnse** using a list of custom Headers. Just run credax against a domain name and let CREDAX do all the work for you.
 Credax uses **127.0.0.1 IP Address** to bypass 403 response. 
 
 You can also set Custom IP Address, Host Address or Path to Bypass 403 Resposne using `-HOST` Switch. 
 
 `python3 -d https://google.com/ -w wordlists.txt -HOST 8.8.8.8`
 
 `python3 -d https://google.com/ -w wordlists.txt -HOST localhost`
 
 `python3 -d https://google.com/ -w wordlists.txt -HOST yourdomain.com`
 
 `python3 -d https://google.com/ -w wordlists.txt -HOST /admin`
